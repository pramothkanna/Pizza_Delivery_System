    <h3 style="margin-top: 40px;">WHO WE ARE</h3><br>
    <p>There's nothing cookie-cutter about Pizza Point.Not our Pizzax.Not our people.And defenitely not the 
        way we live life.Around here, we don't settle for anything less than food we're proud to serve. And 
        we don't just clock in. Not when we can also become our best, make friends, and have fun while we're at it.
        We're the pizza company that lives life unboxed.</p>
    <p>We're not for people who want to blend in:pushing boundaries is part of our heritage.Whether it's the 
        original Stuffed Crust or putting a pizza in outer space,we never stop driving ourselves to deliver hot 
        pizzas,fast every time - anywhere you want to enjoy it.</p><br>
    <h3>WHAT WE'RE ABOUT</h3><br>
    <p>At Pizza Hut, we don’t just make pizza. We make people happy. Pizza Hut was built on the belief that pizza 
       night should be special, and we carry that belief into everything we do. We know how to best serve our 
       customers through tried and true service principles: 
       We create food we’re proud to serve and deliver it fast, with a smile.</p><br>
    <h3>FOR THE LOVE OF PIZZA SINCE 2015</h3><br>
    <p>From day one, we could look our customers in the eye and promise them the finest pizza in town — because
       we knew the farmers who grew the ingredients, and we knew those farmers cared about quality. Since then,
       our farmers have grown right alongside us, and the ingredients we use are still our highest priority. 
       No one loves pizza more than <strong>Pizza Point</strong>. That’s why pizza is in our name — and always will be.</p><br>
